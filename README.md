# Heuristic Solver for RCPSP/t
Implementation of a tournament heuristic using a priority rule, for solving the RCPSP/t (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Time-Dependent Resource Capacities and Requests).

**This is my own implementation of the heuristic algorithm as it is described in a 2013 paper by SÃ¶nke Hartmann:**<br />
